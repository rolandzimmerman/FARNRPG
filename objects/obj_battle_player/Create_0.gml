/// obj_battle_player :: Create Event
/// (Make sure you have this so each battle actor gets its “data” struct on creation.)
//
// You probably already have this in your object. If not, it looks roughly like:
//
persistent = false;  // battle‐only instance, not the overworld player

// no other code here—data is assigned by the Battle Manager in its Create event
